# Task 5 â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that may have influenced passenger survival.  
The analysis includes:
- Data inspection
- Cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Visual exploration
- Statistical testing
- A quick predictive model
